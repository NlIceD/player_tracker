# Basketball Player Tracker
This code requires using [tensorbox](https://github.com/Russell91/TensorBox) to create a model for training.

If you're just interested in running the notebook, a pre-trained model and the test video are located [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nyff8iguizl8mmk/data.tar.gz?dl=0).  Place the video in the data folder and the ckpt file in your output folder

After creating the model run the steps in the pipeline with your model included on a clip of a game.  Currently the model only works in clips that stay on the same half of the court.
