# Basketball Player Tracker
This code requires using [tensorbox](https://github.com/Russell91/TensorBox) to create a model for training.

After creating the model run the steps in the pipeline with your model included on a clip of a game.  Currently the model only works in clips that stay on the same half of the court.
